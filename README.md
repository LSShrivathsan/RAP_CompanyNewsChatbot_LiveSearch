## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Searching for News**
- User enters a company name (e.g., `"Tesla"`).
- The app sends a **Bing News search request** with the query formatted as:  
  ```
  https://www.bing.com/news/search?q={company}+latest+news&qft=sortbydate='1'
  ```
- The HTML page is fetched with a `User-Agent` header to avoid basic bot blocking.

### 2. **Scraping Results**
- The HTML is parsed using **BeautifulSoup**.
- The code checks multiple **headline selectors** (`div.news-card a`, `h2 a`, etc.) to extract links and titles.
- Only articles **containing the company name** are kept.
- The top **5 unique articles** are returned.

### 3. **Fetching Full Article Text**
- The article‚Äôs link is visited.
- All `<p>` tags are extracted and joined into a single string.
- Basic error handling ensures broken links don‚Äôt crash the app.

### 4. **Summarizing with Qwen**
- The **Qwen/Qwen3-8B-FP8** model is loaded via HuggingFace‚Äôs `transformers` library.
- The prompt includes:
  - The desired **summary style**  
  - The company name  
  - The full article text  
- The model generates a concise summary (formal, casual, or bullet points).

### 5. **Chatbot Mode**
- Stores conversation history in `st.session_state.messages`.
- Reconstructs the conversation into a single prompt for Qwen.
- If the user mentions "Company name" with "news" or "latest," it automatically:
  1. Extracts the company name using Qwen.
  2. Searches Bing News.
  3. Summarizes the top articles.
